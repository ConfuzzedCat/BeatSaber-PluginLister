# BeatSaber-PluginLister
Beat saber mods list maker


This is just a simple windows application that makes a "PluginList.txt", that shows game version(from "gameversion.txt") and all .dll files and their version from the plugins folder.


As of right now, it needs to be in the root folder of Beat saber.


See "PluginList.txt"
